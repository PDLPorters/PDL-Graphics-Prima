=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<PDL::Graphics::Prima> fundamentally conceives of two different kinds of
data representations. There are pairwise representations, such as line plot
used to visualize a time series, and there are gridded representations,
such as raster images used to visualize heat maps (or images). Any data that
you want to represent must have some way to conceive of itself as either
pairwise or gridded.

Of course, there are plenty of things we want to visualize that are not
pairwise data or grids. For example, what if we want to plot the
distribution of scores on an exam? In this case, we would probably use a
histogram. When you think about it, a histogram is just a pairwise
visual representation. In other words, to visualize a distribution, we have
to first map the distribution into a pairwise representation, and then
choose an appropriate way to visualize that representation, in this case a
histogram.

So, we have two fundamental ways to represent data, but many possible
data sets. For pairwise representations, we have L<ds::Pair|/Pair>, the
basic pairwise DataSet. L<ds::Dist|/Distribution> is a derived DataSet which
includes a binning specification that bins the distribution into bin centers
(x) and heights (y) to get a pairwise representation. L<ds::Func|/Func>
is another derived DataSet that generates evenly sampled data based on the
axis bounds and evaluates the supplied function at those points to get a
pairwise representation. L<ds::Image|/Image> provides a simple means for
visualizing images, and L<ds::Grid|/Grid> provides a means for mapping a
gridded collection of data into an image, using
L<palettes|PDL::Graphics::Prima::Palette/>.

=head2 Base Class

The Dataset base class provides a few methods that work for all datasets.
These include accessing the associated widget and drawing the data.

=over

=cut

package PDL::Graphics::Prima::DataSet;
use Carp;
use Scalar::Util;

our $VERSION = 0.18;   # update with update-version.pl

=item widget

The widget associated with the dataset.

=cut

sub widget {
	# Simply return the widget if it's a getter:
	return $_[0]->{widget} if @_ == 1;
	
	# It's a setter call, so set self's widget. Note the use of weaken to avoid
	# circular references and memory leaks.
	my ($self, $widget) = @_;
	$self->{widget} = $widget;
	Scalar::Util::weaken($self->{widget});
}

=item draw

Calls all of the drawing functions for each plotType of the dataSet. This also
applies all the global drawing options (like C<color>, for example) that were
supplied to the dataset.

=cut

# Calls all the drawing functions for the plotTypes for this dataset:
sub draw {
	my ($dataset, $canvas, $ratio) = @_;
	my $widget = $dataset->widget;
	
	# Call each plot type's drawing function, in the order specified:
	foreach my $plotType (@{$dataset->{plotTypes}}) {
		$plotType->draw($canvas, $ratio);
	}
}

=item compute_collated_min_max_for

This function is part of the collated min/max chain of function calls that
leads to reasonable autoscaling. The Plot widget asks each dataSet to determine
its collated min and max by calling this function, and this function simply
agregates the collated min and max results from each of its plotTypes.

In general, you needn't worry about collated min and max calculations unless
you are trying to grapple with the autoscaling system or are creating a new
plotType.

working here - link to more complete documentation of the collation and
autoscaling systems.

=cut

# working here - function based datasets with nonzero widths will get
# their x-bounds from the widget, then return wider bounds to accomodate
# the data for the full width. This means that either (1) successive
# resizing will lead to larger and larger bounds or (2) the plots of the
# function-data will be cropped. Of course, all of this is only a problem
# with auto-scaling. Otherwise it gives no trouble.

sub compute_collated_min_max_for {
	# Must get the collated min max for each plot type for this data:
	my ($self, $axis_name, $pixel_extent) = @_;
	my $widget = $self->{dataSets}->{widget};
	
	# Add an initial collection of bad values to handle the special calse of
	# no data sets.
	my @min_collection = (PDL->zeroes($pixel_extent+1)->setvaltobad(0));
	my @max_collection = (PDL->zeroes($pixel_extent+1)->setvaltobad(0));

	foreach my $plotType (@{$self->{plotTypes}}) {
		
		# Accumulate all the collated results
		my ($min, $max)
		= $plotType->compute_collated_min_max_for($axis_name, $pixel_extent);
		# The collated results are not required to be one dimensional.
		# As such, I need to reduce them. I do this by moving the dimension
		# with $pixel_extent entries to the back and then calling minimum
		# until I have only one dimension remaining.
		warn "Internal error: plot type $plotType returned an undefined min"
			if not defined $min;
		warn "Internal error: plot type $plotType returned an undefined max"
			if not defined $max;
		next if not defined $min or not defined $max;
		$min = $min->squeeze->mv(0,-1);
		$min = $min->minimum while($min->ndims > 1);
		$max = $max->squeeze->mv(0,-1);
		$max = $max->maximum while($max->ndims > 1);
		push @min_collection, $min;
		push @max_collection, $max;
	}
	
	# Merge all the data:
	my $collated_min = PDL::cat(@min_collection)->mv(-1,0)->minimum;
	my $collated_max = PDL::cat(@max_collection)->mv(-1,0)->maximum;
	
	return ($collated_min, $collated_max);
}

=item new

This is the universal constructor that is called by the short-name constructors
introduced below. This handles the uniform packaging of plotTypes (for
example, allowing the user to say C<< plotType => ppair::Diamonds >> instead of
the more verbose C<< plotTypes => [ppair::Diamonds] >>). In general, you (the
user) will not need to invoke this constructor directly.

=cut

sub new {
	# Short-name constructors are required to send us stuff that looks like
	# this. In particular, they must pack their data into appropriately
	# named keys among the %options
	my ($class, %options) = @_;
	
	my $self = \%options;
	bless ($self, $class);
	
	# Ensure that we have a plural plotTypes key, and no singular plotType key:
	if (exists $self->{plotType}) {
		my $type = $self->{plotType};
		if (ref($type) eq 'ARRAY') {
			$self->{plotTypes} = $type;
		}
		else {
			$self->{plotTypes} = [$type];
		}
		delete $self->{plotType};
	}
	
	# Ensure that if they supplied a plotTypes, that it is an array reference,
	# not a singulare plotType:
	$self->{plotTypes} = [$self->{plotTypes}]
		if (exists $self->{plotTypes} and ref($self->{plotTypes}) ne 'ARRAY');
	
	# Initialize (and validate) the dataSet
	$self->init;
	
	# Make sure that the plotTypes know which dataSet they belong to:
	for my $plotType (@{$self->{plotTypes}}) {
		$plotType->dataset($self);
	}
	
	return $self;
}


=item check_plot_types

Checks that the plotType(s) passed to the constructor or added at runtime are
built on the data type tha we expect. Derived classes must specify their
C<plotType_base_class> key before calling this function.

=cut

sub check_plot_types {
	my ($self, @plotTypes) = @_;
	my $expected_plot_class = $self->expected_plot_class;
	foreach (@plotTypes) {
		croak("Plottype should be of type $expected_plot_class, but it is of type "
			. ref($_)) unless eval{$_->isa($expected_plot_class)}
						or eval{$_->isa('PDL::Graphics::Prima::PlotType::CallBack')}
							and eval{$_->{base_class}->isa($expected_plot_class)};
	}
}

=item init

Called by new to initialize the dataset. This function is called on the new
dataset just before it is returned from C<new>.

If you create a new dataSet, you should provide an C<init> function that
performs the following:

=over

=item supply a default plotType

If the user supplied something to either the C<plotType> or C<plotTypes> keys,
then C<new> will be sure you have you will already have that something in
an array reference in C<< $self->{plotTypes} >>. However, if they did not supply
either key, you should supply a default. You should have something that looks
like this:

 $self->{plotTypes} = [pset::CDF] unless exists $self->{plotTypes};

=item check the plot types

After supplying a default plot type, you should check that the provided plot
types are derived from the acceptable base plot type class. You would do this
with code like this:

 $self->check_plot_types(@{self->{plotTypes}});

=back

This is your last step to validate or pre-calculate anything. For example, you
must provide functions to return your data, and you should probably make
guarantees about the kinds of data that such accessors return, such as the data
always being a piddle. If that is the case, then it might not be a bad idea to
say in your C<init> function something like this:

 $self->{data} = PDL::Core::topdl($self->{data});

=cut

sub init {
	my $self = shift;
	die "The class for $self does not define an init function!";
}

=item change_data

Sets the data to the given data by calling the derived class's C<_change_data>
method. Unlike C<_change_data>, this method also issues a C<ChangeData>
notification to the widget. This means that you should only use this method
once the dataset has been associated with a widget. Each class expects
different arguments, so you should look at the class's documentation for
details on what to send to the method.

=cut

# Sets the data and issues a notification
sub change_data {
	my $self = shift;
	$self->_change_data(@_);
	$self->widget->notify('ChangeData', $self);
}

=item compute_color_map_extrema

Multiple datasets and plot types can use the plot-wide color map. In that case,
the color map needs to figure out the minimum and maximum values from the data.
All datasets must run through their collection of plotTypes and ask each one for
its color map extrema. PlotTypes should either return an empty list (indicating
they are not using the plot-wide color map) or the lowest minimum value and the
largest maximum value needed to render their data.

=cut

sub compute_color_map_extrema {
	my $self = shift;
	# If we have an explicit palette, then we're not using the system palette
	return if $self->has_custom_color_map;
	# Iterate through all plot types
	my @minmax;
	for my $plotType (@{$self->{plotTypes}}) {
		my @curr_minmax = $plotType->compute_color_map_extrema;
		if (@curr_minmax) {
			if (@minmax) {
				$minmax[0] = $curr_minmax[0] if $minmax[0] > $curr_minmax[0];
				$minmax[1] = $curr_minmax[1] if $minmax[1] < $curr_minmax[1];
			}
			else {
				@minmax = @curr_minmax;
			}
		}
	}
	return @minmax;
}

=item has_custom_color_map

Returns true if the dataset has its own color map, false otherwise.

=cut

sub has_custom_color_map {
	my $self = shift;
	return 1 if $self->{color_map};
}

=item color_map

Returns the color map of either the dataset or, if the dataset does not have a
custom color map, the plot-wide color map.

=cut

sub color_map {
	my $self = shift;
	return $self->{color_map} // $self->widget->color_map;
}

=head2 Pair

Pairwise datasets are collections of paired x/y data. A typical Pair dataset
is the sort of thing you would visualize with an x/y plot: a time series
such as the series of high temperatures for each day in a month or the x- and
y-coordinates of a bug walking across your desk. PDL::Graphics::Prima provides
many ways of visualizing Pair datasets, as discussed under
L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::PlotType/Pair>.

The dimensions of pluralized properties (i.e. C<colors>) should
thread-match the dimensions of the data. An important exception to this is
C<ppair::Lines>, in which case you must specify how you want properties to thread.

The default plot type is C<ppair::Diamonds>.

=over

=item ds::Pair - short-name constructor

=for sig

    ds::Pair($x_data, $y_data, option => value, ...)

piddles in a list.

=head2 Distribution

Distributions are unordered collections of sample data. The typical use case
of a distribution is that you have a population of things and you want to
analyze their agregate properties. For example, you might be interested in
the distribution of tree heights at your Christmas Tree Farm, or the
distribution of your students' (or your classmates') test scores from the
mid-term. Common ways for visualizing distributions are to plot their
cumulative distribution functions or their histogram, but those are actually
classic pairwise data visualization approaches. That means that what we really
need are means for converting unordered sets of data into pairwise data.
Distributions, therefore, let you specify the means by which your unordered
data should be transformed into pairwise data, and the pairwise plot types to
visualize the resulting transformed data. In an object oriented sense, the
Distribution class is derived from the Pairwise class because a distribution
B<is visualized> using pairwise plot types.

Note that shape of pluralized properties (i.e. C<colors>) should
thread-match the shape of the data B<excluding> the data's first dimension.
That is, if I want to plot the cumulative distributions for three different
batches using three different line colors, my data would have shape (N, 3) and
my colors piddle would have shape (3).

PDL::Graphics::Prima's notion of distributions is not yet finalized and is
open to suggestion. If you find yourself using distribution plots regularly,
you should give me feedback on what works and what doesn't. Thanks!

=item ds::Dist - short-name constructor

=for sig

    ds::Dist($data, option => value, ...)

piddle of values or an array reference of values (which will be converted to
a piddle during initialization).

=cut

package 
bt;

use Carp;

=pod

In addition to the standard keys, there is also the C<binning> key. The
C<binning> key expects either a standard binning approach using one of the
pre-defined forms, or a subroutine reference that performs the binning
in a customized fashion. The binning types are all functions that expect
key/value pairs that include C<min> and C<max> for the lower and upper
threshold of the binning, C<drop_extremes> to indicate if the data outside
the min/max range should be included in the first and last bins, and
C<normalize> to indicate if the binning should be normalized to 1, for some
appropriate definition of normalization. Other keys may also be allowed.

If you want to write a customized binning function, it should accept the
two arguments, the C<data> to bin and the C<distribution> object. It should
return a pair of piddles representing the x and y coordinates to plot. In
addition, if the binning routine knows how to calculate properties for
specific plot types, it can specify the plot type and any properties that it
would provide for that plot type.

For example, if you write a binning routine that knows how to calculate
the bin boundaries for the Histogram plot type, your return statement could
look like this:

 return ($x, $y, Histogram => { binEdges => $bounds } );

If your binning routine uses the number of points in a Symbols plot type to
represent something, it could specify those:

 return ($x, $y, Symbols => { N_points => $n_points } );

If you have a means for calculating the error on your bins, you could
include the error bar data:

 return ($x, $y, ErrorBars => { y_err => $count_err } );

These properties will be applied to the relevant plot types just before
drawing and autoscaling operations, and any dataset operation that makes
use of your supplied function should examine the additional parameters and
act accordingly.

The standard binning types include:

=over

=item bt::CDF

Generates a cumulative distribution from the data. The default C<min> is the
data's minimum, the default C<max> is the data's maximum, the binning will not
C<drop_extremes> by default (i.e. C<< drop_extremes => 0 >>) and the binning
normalizes the data (i.e. C<< normalize => 1 >>). You can also specify if you
want an increasing or decreasing representation by specifying a boolean value
for the C<increasing> key (the default is increasing, i.e. true).

In the context of the CDF, normalization refers to the curve runnning from
y = 0 to y = N - 1 (not normalized) or from y = 0 to y = 1 (normalized).
Bear in mind that this interacts with your choice to drop the extremes or not.

In producing the CDF, bad values are simply skipped.

=item bt::Linear

Generates a histogram from the data with linear spacing. The default C<min> is the
data's minimum, the default C<max> is the data's maximum, the binning will
C<drop_extremes> by default (i.e. C<< drop_extremes => 1 >>) and the binning
normalizes the data (i.e. C<< normalize => 1 >>). You can also specify the
number of bins with C<nbins>. The default is 20. If you want empty bins to
be marked as bad, specify C<< mark_empty_as => 'bad' >>. The default is to
mark them as zero.

In this case, normalization means that the "integral" of the histogram is
1, which means that the sum of the heights I<times the widths> is 1.

=item bt::Log

Generates a histogram from the data with logarithmic spacing. The default
C<min> is the data's smallest positive value and the default max is the data's
maximum value. If none of the data is positive, the binning type croaks.
The binning will C<drop_extremes> by default (i.e. C<< drop_extremes => 1 >>)
and the binning normalizes the data (i.e. C<< normalize => 1 >>). You can also
specify the number of bins with C<nbins>. The default is 20. If you want empty bins to
be marked as bad, specify C<< mark_empty_as => 'bad' >>. The default is to
mark them as zero.

As with linear binning, normalization means that the "integral" of the histogram is
1, which means that the sum of the heights I<times the widths> is 1.

=item bt::StrictLog

Identical to L<bt::Log|/bt::Log>, except that it croaks if it encounters
B<any> negative values. You can use this in place of L<bt::Log|/bt::Log> to
sanity check your data.

=item bt::NormFit

"Fits" the distribution between the specified min and max (defaults to the
data's min and max) to a normal distribution. This bin type does not pay
attention to the C<drop_extremes> key, but it cares about the C<normalize>
key. If unspecified (the default), the curve will be scaled so that the area
underneath it is the number of data points being fit. If normalized, the
curve will be scaled so that the area under the curve will be 1. You can
also specify the number of points to use in generating the curves by including
the C<N_points> key/value pair.

I am pondering allowing the curve's min/max to take the current axis bounds
min/max if the axes are not autoscaling. Thoughts appreciated.

=head2 Grid

Grids are collections of data that is regularly ordered in two dimensions. Put
differently, it is a structure in which the data is described by two indices.
The analogous mathematical structure is a matrix and the analogous visual is an
image. PDL::Graphics::Prima provides a few ways to visualize grids, as
discussed under L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::PlotType/Grids>. The default plot type
is C<pgrid::Color>.

This is the least well thought-out dataSet. As such, it may change in the
future. All such changes will, hopefully, be backwards compatible.

At the moment, there is only one way to visualize grid data: C<pgrid::Matrix>.
Although I can conceive of a contour plot, it has yet to be implemented. As
such, it is hard to specify the dimension requirements for dataset-wide
properties. There are a few dataset-wide properties discussed in the
constructor, however, so see them for some examples.

=over

=item ds::Grid - short-name constructor

=for sig

    ds::Grid($matrix, option => value, ...)

The short-name constructor to create grids. The data should be a piddle of
values or something which topdl can convert to a piddle (an array reference of
array references).

The current cross-plot-type options include the bounds settings. You can either
specify a C<bounds> key or one key from each column:

 x_bounds   y_bounds
 x_centers  y_centers
 x_edges    y_edges

=over

=item bounds

The value associated with the C<bounds> key is a four-element anonymous array:

 bounds => [$left, $bottom, $right, $top]

The values can either be scalars or piddles that indicate the corners of the
grid plotting area. If the latter, it is possible to thread over the bounds by
having the shape of (say) C<$left> thread-match the shape of your grid's data,
excluding the first two dimensions. That is, if your C<$matrix> has
a shape of (20, 30, 4, 5), the piddle for C<$left> can have shapes of (1), (4),
(4, 1), (1, 5), or (4, 5).

At the moment, if you specify bounds, linear spacing from the min to the max is
used. In the future, a new key may be introduced to allow you to specify the
spacing as something besides linear.

=item x_bounds, y_bounds

The values associated with C<x_bounds> and C<y_bounds> are anonymous arrays with
two elements containing the same sorts of data as the C<bounds> array.

=item x_centers, y_centers

The value associated with C<x_centers> (or C<y_centers>) should be a piddle with
increasing values of x (or y) that give the mid-points of the data. For example,
if we have a matrix with shape (3, 4), C<x_centers> would have 3 elements and
C<y_centers> would have 4 elements:

    -------------------
 y3 | d03 | d13 | d23 |
    -------------------
 y2 | d02 | d12 | d22 |
    -------------------
 y1 | d01 | d11 | d21 |
    -------------------
 y0 | d00 | d10 | d20 |
    -------------------
      x0    x1    x2

Some plot types may require the edges. In that case, if there is more than one
point, the plot guesses the scaling of the spacing between points (choosing
between logarithmic or linear) and appropriate bounds for the given scaling are
calculated using interpolation and extrapolation. The plot will croak if there
is only one point (in which case interpolation is not possible). If the spacing
for your grid is neither linear nor logarithmic, you should explicitly specify
the edges, as discussed next.

At the moment, the guess work assumes that all the scalings for a given Grid
dataset are either linear or logarithmic, even though it's possible to mix
the scaling using threading. (It's hard to do that by accident, so if that last
bit seems confusing, then you probably don't need to worry about tripping on
it.) Also, I would like for the plot to croak if the scaling does not appear to
be either linear or logarithmic, but that is not yet implemented.

=item x_edges, y_edges

The value associated with C<x_edges> (or C<y_edges>) should be a piddle with
increasing values of x (or y) that give the boundary edges of data. For example,
if we have a matrix with shape (3, 4), C<x_edges> would have 3 + 1 = 4 elements
and C<y_edges> would have 4 + 1 = 5 elements:

 y4 -------------------
    | d03 | d13 | d23 |
 y3 -------------------
    | d02 | d12 | d22 |
 y2 -------------------
    | d01 | d11 | d21 |
 y1 -------------------
    | d00 | d10 | d20 |
 y0 -------------------
    x0    x1    x2    x3

Some plot types may require the data centers. In that case, if there are only
two edges, a linear interpolation is used. If there are more than two points,
the plot will try to guess the spacing, choosing between linear and logarithmic,
and use the appropriate interpolation.

The note above about regarding guess work for x_centers and y_centers applies
here, also.

=head2 Image

Images are like Grids (they are derived from Grids, actually) but they have
a specified color format. Since they have a color format, this means that
they need to hold information for different aspects of each color, so they
typically have one more dimension than Grids. That is, where a grid might
have dimensions M x N, an rgb or hsv image would have dimensions 3 x M x N.

The default image format is rgb. Currently supported image formats are
rgb (red-green-blue), hsv (hugh-saturation-value), and prima (Prima's internal
color format, which is a packed form of rgb).

As Images are derived from Grids, any method you can call on a Grid you can
also call on an Image. Differences and details specific to Images include:

=item ds::Image - short-name constructor

=for sig

    ds::Image($image, option => value, ...)

Creates an Image dataset. A particularly important key is the C<color_format>
key, which indicates the format of the C<$image> piddle. When it comes to
drawing the image, the data will be converted to a set of Prima colors,
which means that the first dimension will be reduced away. Values associated
with keys should be thread-compatible with the dimensions starting from the
second dimension, so if your image has dims 3 x M x N, values associated
with your various keys should be thread-compatible with an M x N piddle.

Note that color formats are case insensitive. At the moment there is no way
to add new color formats, but you should expect a color format API to come
at some point in the not-distant future. It will very likely make use of
L<PDL::Graphics::ColorSpace>, so if you want your own special color format
to be used for Images, you should contribute to that project.

=head2 Func

PDL::Graphics::Prima provides a special pair dataset that takes a function
reference instead of a set of data. The function should take a piddle of x-values
as input and compute and return the y-values. You can specify the number of data
points by supplying

 N_points => value

in the list of key-value pairs that initialize the dataset. Most of the
functionality is inherited from C<PDL::Graphics::Prima::DataSet::Pair>, but
there are a few exceptions.

=item ds::Func - short-name constructor

=for sig

    ds::Func($subroutine, option => value, ...)

The short-name constructor to create function datasets. The subroutine must be
a reference to a subroutine, or an anonymous sub. For example, 

=for example

 # Reference to a subroutine,
 # PDL's exponential function:
 ds::Func (\&PDL::exp)

 # Using an anonymous subroutine:
 ds::Func ( sub {
     my $xs = shift;
     return $xs->exp;
 })

}

# Even less to do for this than for a normal dataset. Just verify the function,
# store it in $self, and ensure we have a sensible value for N_points. Note
# that there is no way to ensure that the supplied function takes a piddle;
# we'll just have to take it on faith.
sub init {
	my $self = shift;
	
	# Supply a default plot type:
	$self->{plotTypes} = [ppair::Lines] unless exists $self->{plotTypes};
	
	# Set the default number of data points (for evaluated data) to 200:
	$self->{N_points} ||= 200;
	
	# Ensure that they provided *something* for the func key
	croak('You must supply a function under the "func" key')
		unless exists $self->{func};
	
	# Set the function and number of points
	$self->_change_data($self->{func}, $self->{N_points});
}

=item change_data

Sets the function and/or the number of points to evaluate. The basic usage
looks like this:

 $plot->dataSets->{'curve'}->change_data(\&some_func, $N_points);

Either of the arguments can be undefined if you want to change only the
other. That means that you can change the function without changing the
number of evaluation points like this:

 $plot->dataSets->{'curve'}->change_data(\&some_func);

and you can change the number of evaluation points without changing the
function like this:

 $plot->dataSets->{'curve'}->change_data(undef, $N_points);

and using that to compute the y-data. The x-data is uniformly sampled
according to the x-axis scaling.

This function is supposed to provide information for autoscaling. This is a
sensible thing to do for the the y-values of functions, but it makes no
situation with the x-values since these are taken from the x-axis min and
max already.

This could be smarter, methinks, so please give me your ideas if you have
them. :-)

=item ds::Note - short-name constructor for annotations

=for sig

    ds::Note(plotType, plotType, ..., drawing => option, drawing => option)

The short-name constructor to create annotations. This expects a list of
annotation plot types fullowed by a list of general drawing options, such as
line width or color. For example, 

=for example

 ds::Note(
     pnote::Region(
         # args here
     ),
     pnote::Text('text',
         # args here
     ),
     ... more note objects ...
     # Dataset drawing options
     color => cl::LightRed,
     ...
 );

Unlike other dataset short-form constructors, you do not need to specify the
plotTypes key explicitly, though if you did it would do what you mean. That is,
the previous example would give identical results as this:

 ds::Note(
     plotTypes => [
         pnote::Region(
             # args here
         ),
         pnote::Text('text',
             # args here
         ),
         ... more note objects ...
     ],
     # Dataset drawing options
     color => cl::LightRed,
     ...
 );

The former is simply offered as a convenience for this more long-winded form.

The dataset collection is the thing that actually holds the datasets in the

data members as if they were hash elements. However, it does some
double-checking for you behind the scenes to make sure that whenever you
add a dataset to the Collection, that you added a real DataSet object and
not some arbitrary thing.

=head1 RESPONSIBILITIES

The datasets and the dataset collection have a number of responsibilities, and
a number of things for whch they are not responsible. 

The dataset container is responsible for:

=over

=item knowing the plot widget

The container always maintains knowledge of the plot widget to which it belongs.
Put a bit differently, a dataset container cannot belong to multiple plot
widgets (at least, not at the moment).

=item informing datasets of their container and plot widget

When a dataset is added to a dataset collection, the collection is responsible
for informing the dataset of the plot object and the dataset collection to which
the dataset belongs.

=back

Datasets themselves are responsible for:

=over

=item knowing and managing the plotTypes

The datasets are responsible for maintaining the list of plotTypes that are to
be applied to their data.

=item knowing per-dataset properties

Drawing properties can be specified on a per-dataset scope. The dataset is
responsible for maintaining a list of these properties and providing them to
the plot types when they perform drawing operations.

=item knowing the dataset container and the plot widget

All datasets know the dataset container and the plot widget to which they belong.
Although they could retrieve the widget through a method on the container, the


=item informing plotTyes' plot widget

The plot types all know the widget (and dataset) to which they belong, and it is
the 

=item managing the drawing operations of plotTypes

Although datasets themselves do not need to draw anything, they do call the
drawing operations of the different plot types that they contain. 

=item knowing and supplying the data

A key responsibility for the dataSets is holding the data that are drawn by the
plot types. Althrough the plot types may hold specialized data, the dataset
holds the actual data the underlies the plot types and provides a specific
interface for the plot types to access that data.

=back

On the other hand, datasets are not responsible for knowing or doing any of the
following:

=over

=item knowing axes

The plot object is responsible for knowing the x- and y-axis objects. However,
if the axis system is changed to allow for multiple x- and y-axes, then this
burden will shift to the dataset as it will need to know which axis to use when
performing data <-> pixel conversions.

=back

=head1 TODO

Add optional bounds to function-based DataSets.

Captitalization for plotType, etc.

Use PDL documentation conventions for signatures, ref, etc.

Additional datset, a two-tone grid. Imagine that you want to overlay the
population density of a country and the average rainfall (at the granularity
of counties, let's say). You could use the intensity of the red channel to
indicate population and the intensity of blue to indicate rainfall. Highly
populated areas with low rainfall would be bright red, while highly populated
areas with high rainfall would be purple, and low populated areas with high
rainfall would be blue. The color scale would be indicated
with a square with a color gradient (rather than a horizontal or vertical bar
with a color gradient, as in a normal ColorGrid). Anyway, this differs from
a normal grid dataset because it would require two datasets, one for each
tone.
