At the moment there are two kinds of datasets. The piddle-based datasets have
piddles for their x- and y-data. The function-based datasets create their
x-values on the fly and evaluate their y-values using the supplied function
reference. The x-values are generated using the C<sample_evenly> function which
belongs to the x-axis's scaling object/class. As such, any scaling class needs
to implement a C<sample_evenly> function to support function-based datasets.

use PDL::Graphics::Prima::PlotType;
use PDL::Core ':Internal'; # for topdl
use Carp 'croak';
use strict;
use warnings;

=head2 PDL::Graphics::Prima::DataSet::new

This creates a new dataset. It is written to handle subclasses correctly, and
as such should not generally be overridden. Override the C<initialize> function
instead.

There are at least three ways to indicate the x/y coordinates for a dataset.

=over

=item explicit x, y

You can provide explicit x- and y- piddles for your data.

=item explicit x, function for y

You can provide a set of x values and a function that the plotter evaluates
for you at those x values.

=item no x, function for y

You can simply provide a function for y which is evaluated based upon the bounds
of the plot. This can lead to problems if you simply try to plot a function without
specifying those bounds. It will try to compute the bounds automatically and
then fail.

=back

The new function takes a class name and an anonymous array. The anonymous array
has either one or two x/y arguments (as just explained) followed by key => value
pairs. All key => value pairs are stored in the underlying hash that constitutes
the DataSet object.

The keys associated with arguments to the polylines command are used during the
drawing commands. In particular, color, backColor, linePattern, lineWidth,
lineJoin, lineEnd, rop, and rop2 can be used to specify each of these properties
for the drawing of the function. Furthermore, their plurals can be used to
specify piddles for these properties if you want to PDL-thread different
properties for different curves. That is particularly useful if you are drawing
(say) 30 lines for which the line color indicates a parameter that describes the
line.

For example, this draws a red curve:

  [ $x, $y, color => cl::Red ]

This draws ideally multiple curves in which the curve colors are specified in
C<$colors_piddle>:

  [ $xs, $ys, colors => $colors_piddle ]

=head2 initialize

Perform any dataset-specific initialization. For piddle-based datasets, this
simply ensures that the data stored in the object are piddles. In other words,
if you pass in a scalar value, it will be converted to a piddle internally, to
simplify the internal routines.

Note that part of the initialization (at the moment) is to set infinite and nan
values to bad in place, which modifies the underlying piddle.

In the base class, the initialize function converst scalars to piddles. These
can be constants, or they can be array refs, since the pdl function knows how to
convert array refs to piddles.

=cut

sub initialize {
	# Not much to do here. This just pulls the x- and y- data out of the passed
	# array reference, packages them in piddles if they are scalars, and stores

	my $xs = $array_ref->[0];
	my $ys = $array_ref->[1];

		$ys = topdl($ys);
# Unnecessary with the collation setup:
#		# Set infinity and nan to bad values:
#		$xs->inplace->setnantobad;
#		$ys->inplace->setnantobad;
		$dataset->{xs} = $xs;
		$dataset->{ys} = $ys;

applies all the global drawing options (like C<color>, for example) that were
supplied to the dataset.

points by supplying
