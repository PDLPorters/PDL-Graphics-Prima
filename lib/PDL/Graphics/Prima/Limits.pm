=head1 NAME

PDL::Graphics::Prima::Limits - defining a couple of useful constants

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You probably won't ever need to use this module explicitly. It defines the
constants C<lm::Auto> and C<lm::Hold>, which are described in
L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::Axis>, L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::Simple>, and elsewhere.

=head1 SEE ALSO

This is a component of L<PDL::Graphics::Prima>. This library is composed of many
modules, including:

=over

=item L<PDL::Graphics::Prima>

Defines the Plot widget for use in Prima applications

=item L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::Axis>

Specifies the behavior of axes (but not the scaling)

=item L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::DataSet>

Specifies the behavior of DataSets

=item L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::Internals>

A dumping ground for my partial documentation of some of the more complicated
stuff. It's not organized, so you probably shouldn't read it.

=item L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::Limits>

Defines the lm:: namespace

=item L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::Palette>

Specifies a collection of different color palettes

=item L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::PlotType>

Defines the different ways to visualize your data

=item L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::Scaling>

Specifies different kinds of scaling, including linear and logarithmic

=item L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::Simple>

Defines a number of useful functions for generating simple and not-so-simple
plots
