=head1 NAME

PDL::Graphics::Prima - an interactive plotting widget and library for PDL and Prima

=head1 SIMPLE SYNOPSIS

 use PDL::Graphics::Prima::Simple;
 use PDL;
 
 
 # --( Super simple line and symbol plots )--
 
 # Generate some data - a sine curve
 my $x = sequence(100) / 20;
 my $y = sin($x);
 
 # Draw x/y pairs. Default x-value are sequential:
 line_plot($y);        line_plot($x, $y);
 circle_plot($y);      circle_plot($x, $y);
 triangle_plot($y);    triangle_plot($x, $y);
 square_plot($y);      square_plot($x, $y);
 diamond_plot($y);     diamond_plot($x, $y);
 X_plot($y);           X_plot($x, $y);
 cross_plot($y);       cross_plot($x, $y);
 asterisk_plot($y);    asterisk_plot($x, $y);
 
 # Sketch the sine function for x initially from 0 to 10:
 func_plot(0 => 10, \&PDL::sin);
 
 
 # --( Super simple histogram )--
 
 # PDL hist method returns x/y data
 hist_plot($y->hist);
 my ($bin_centers, $heights) = $y->hist;
 hist_plot($bin_centers, $heights);
 # Even simpler, if of limited use:
 hist_plot($heights);
 
 
 # --( Super simple matrix plots )--
 
 # Generate some data - a wavy pattern
 my $image = sin(sequence(100)/10)
             + sin(sequence(100)/20)->transpose;
 
 # Generate a greyscale image:
 matrix_plot($image);  # smallest is white
 imag_plot($image);    # smallest is black
 
 # Set the x and y coordinates for the image boundaries
 #            left, right,  bottom, top
 matrix_plot([ 0,     1  ], [ 0,     2 ],  $image);
 imag_plot(  [ 0,     1  ], [ 0,     2 ],  $image);
 
 
 # --( More complex plots )--
 
 # Use the more general 'plot' function for
 # multiple datasets and more plotting features:
 my $colors = pal::Rainbow()->apply($x);
 plot(
     -lines         => ds::Pair($x, $y
         , plotType => ppair::Lines
     ),

         , colors   => $colors,
         , plotType => ppair::Squares(filled => 1)
     ),
     
     x => { label   => 'Time' },
     y => { label   => 'Sine' },
 );

=head1 WIDGET SYNOPSIS

=head1 IF YOU ARE NEW

If you are new to C<PDL::Graphics::Prima>, you should begin by reading the
documentation for L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::Simple>. This module provides a
simplified interface for quickly dashing off a few plots and offers stepping
stones to create more complex plots. Depending on your plotting needs, you may
not need anything more complicated than L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::Simple>. However,
C<PDL::Graphics::Prima> offers much greater flexibility and interactivity than
the options available in the Simple interface, so once you feel comfortable,
you should come back to this manual page and learn how to create and utilize
Plot widgets in conjunction with the Prima GUI toolkit.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PDL::Graphics::Prima is a plotting interface for creating and exploring 2D data
visualizations. The core of this interace is a Plot widget that can be
incorporated into Prima applications.

=head1 Properties

=head2 title, titleSpace

Sets or gets the string that contains the title and the space allocated for the
title at the top of the plot.

=cut

sub _title {
	$_[0]->{title} = $_[1];
}

sub title {
	return $_[0]->{title} unless $#_;
	$_[0]->_title($_[1]);
	$_[0]->notify('ChangeTitle');
}

sub _titleSpace {
	my ($self, $new_space) = @_;

}

sub titleSpace {
	return $_[0]->{titleSpace} unless $#_;
	$_[0]->_titleSpace($_[1]);
	$_[0]->notify('ChangeTitle');
}

=head2 dataSets

This either sets or returns the data sets. The data sets are held in a tied
anonymous hash that you directly manipulate. In order to add a new dataset,
you don't have to make a second call to dataSets; you can
simply modify the anonymous hash in place using standard Perl hash
manipulation functions. Since the hash is actually tied, datasets that you
add will be validated as you add them.

=cut

sub dataSets {
	# Return the (tied) hash ref if called as a getter:
	return $_[0]->{dataSets} unless $#_;
	# If called as a setter, copy all the values. This may seem inefficient,
	# but it automatically performs all the data validation for me:
	my ($self, %new_data) = @_;
	
	# Clear the dataset (except the widget key, whick never disappears):
	%{$self->{dataSets}} = ();
	
	# Add each dataset individually, to ensure the validation does what it's
	# supposed to do:
	while(my ($key, $dataset) = each %new_data) {
		$self->{dataSets}->{$key} = $dataset;
	}
	
	# Don't need to issue a notification because that already happened with
	# the above assignments.
	#$self->notify('ChangeData');
}

# For a change in title, recompute the autoscaling and replot.
sub on_changetitle {
	my $self = shift;
	$self->x->update_edges;
	$self->y->update_edges;
	$self->notify('Replot');
}

# for now, this is a replica of the above:
*on_changedata = \&on_changetitle;

# Sets up a timer in self that eventually calls the paint notification:
sub on_replot {
	my ($self) = @_;
	return if $self->{timer}->get_active;
	$self->{timer}->start;
}

=head1 Events

You can send notifications and hook callbacks for the following events:

=head2 ChangeTitle

Called when the title or titleSpace gets changed

=head2 Replot

Called when the widget needs to replot

=head2 ChangeData

Called when the dataSet container changes (not the datasets themselves, but
the whole container).

=head1 RESPONSIBILITIES

The Plot object itself has to coordinate a number of sub-systems in order to get
a functioning plot. As these responsiblities are not always clear even to their
author, here is a list of what the plot is responsible for handling.

=over

=item knowing the plot title

Although the axes are responsible for knowing the axis labels, the plot itself
is responsible for knowing the plot title.

=item initiating drawing operations

The drawing of the axes, data, and plot title are all coordinated, ultimately,
by the plot object.

=item initiating autoscaling

Autoscaling for either of the axes is initiated by a call to the plot object's
C<compute_min_max_for>, which computes the minima and maxima for a given axis.
Most of the calculations necessary for this operation are performed by the
dataset and the underlying plotTypes, but they are coordinated and synthesized
by the plot object.

=item managing the dataset container

The plot does not manage the datasets directly, but it owns the dataset
container that is responsible for this.

=item handling user interaction

All user interaction (which at the moment is limited to mouse interaction) is
handled by the plot object. Drag and zoom events ultimately lead to changes in
the axes' minima and maxima (the axes are responsible for these pieces of
information), but these changes are initiated through the plot object.

=back

Many things are B<not> the responsiblity of the plot object but are instead
handled by other objects, usually held as objects within the plot object itself.

=over

=item tick and axis details

All axis and tick details, including minima and maxima, scaling, tick mark
locations, axis labels, and conversion from real x and y data values to pixel
offsets are handled by the axis objects.

=item managing datasets or plotTypes

The datasets are managed by the dataset collection hashref defined in
L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::DataSet>. Any access to the datasets (outside of 
declaring them directly in the constructor, which is a special-case) is managed
throug the dataSet collection. Any access to the specific plot types are 
themselves handled by the datasets themselves.

=back

=head1 TODO

Idea: set the ability to buffer replot notifications, so that you can fiddle
with datasets without triggering a replot. That should improve performance when
multiple datasets are dynamically added and removed. Then again, this is likely
to be a problem only with very large datasets.

This is not a perfect plotting library. Here are some of the particularly
annoying issues with it, which I hope to resolve:

adjustable right and bottom margins means mouse scroll-wheel action doesn't
work exactly as advertised

something's messed up with the x-ticks, and sometimes the left x-tick does not
line-up with the edge of the horizontal axis line.

linear tick scaling can switch the 'natural' major and minor ticks just by
moving, which makes it seem jittery. The function for determining the major and
minor ticks should be simplified and based only on the scale of interest.

singular properties (like C<color>, as opposed to C<colors>) do not Do What You
Mean. With PlotTypes, they often don't do anything at all. Although I could
resolve this problem in this library, I would rather address this in
L<PDL::Drawing::Prima>.

Shouldn't singular names => scalars, plural names => piddles be consistent
across the board? It's not, at least not with the plotTypes.

multiple axes. In the constructor, any property that starts with x would be an
x-axis (x1, x2, etc). You would have to specify an axes with a dataset, though
the default would be the first axis when sorted asciibetically. Axes would have
properties regarding if they are drawn on the top, the bottom, both, etc, and
whether their tick labels are drawn on the top, bottom, etc.

I am very proud of the automatic scaling. There are two drawbacks. (1) It's
complicated and not yet well documented. That needs fixing. (2) It could be even
more awesome. For example, it would be great to be able to specify a minimum 
pixel padding, as well as an extra pixel padding. This would simply effect how
collate_min_max_for_many works and should be a snap to implement.

Handle the titleSpace in a more intelligent way

Both the L<Perl Data Language|PDL> and the L<Prima GUI Toolkit|Prima> are
amazing and this module would have no reason for existence without both of them.

This module serves as the motivation for L<PDL::Drawing::Prima>, and also would
be unable to function with any efficiency without it.

Other 2D plotting options include L<PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT>,
L<PDL::Graphics::PLplot>, L<PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot>, L<PDL::Graphics::Asymptote>,
and many others. Search CPAN for more.

For 3D plotting, see L<PDL::Graphics::TriD>.

Here is the full list of modules in this distribution:

=over

=item L<PDL::Graphics::Prima>

Defines the Plot widget for use in Prima applications

=item L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::Axis>

Specifies the behavior of axes (but not the scaling)

=item L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::DataSet>

Specifies the behavior of DataSets

=item L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::Internals>

A dumping ground for my partial documentation of some of the more complicated
stuff. It's not organized, so you probably shouldn't read it.

=item L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::Limits>

Defines the lm:: namespace

=item L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::Palette>

Specifies a collection of different color palettes

=item L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::PlotType>

Defines the different ways to visualize your data

=item L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::Scaling>

Specifies different kinds of scaling, including linear and logarithmic

=item L<PDL::Graphics::Prima::Simple>

Defines a number of useful functions for generating simple and not-so-simple
plots
